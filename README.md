# Rotary Display Stand
Main purpose of this device is facilitating work for a photograher or who wants to rest the object in some positions.
He's able to set the correct position by switch on a electric motor.

The project is origin from 2014 when I applied job for <a href="https://3epraha.cz/">3E Praha Engineering</a> and I had to show my ability to make a machine design independently. It means gather information about stardardized parts (steel profiles and fasteners), 
strength calculations, proposal method of transfer power, etc.

The machine is propulsed by stepper motor (torque is 10 Nm) which take energy from DC grid.
